# Click escape codes

Click escape codes are a vital feature in the modern TalkScript project. They are designed to let you type in things like:

```python
print ("Hello world")
```

without it becoming this:

```python
print left parentheses quotation marks hello world quotation marks right parentheses
```

Essentially, they are a break point where you can start entering codes for numbers, punctuation, and other special characters without it being entered as a word.

This breakthrough feature was discovered and invented by [Seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) on Monday, July 5th 2021, early in the afternoon. It is a groundbreaking feature that allows this project to continue.
