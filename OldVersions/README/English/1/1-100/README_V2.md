Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_AndrOpen-Office/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate (pretty ironic for an anti-Google campaign) I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 9th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

# TalkScript
An older idea I had for a programming language IDE that works entirely through voice, so people who are blind, or have no arms can program, or even people who just want to program by simply talking script.

***

# About

See above. TalkScript is a programming language IDE that enables voice-based programming through the usage of click escape codes. It can be compiled into any programming language, and everything in the program, including launching it, is planned to be able to be done just with your voice.

## Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/TalkScript/wiki)

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

# Click escape codes

## July 5th 2021 draft version 2

Click escape codes are a planned key feature that makes TalkScript work. This feature is on the IDE end. A user must make this sound to enter numbers, punctuation, and other special characters.

### Sample 1

#### Voice input 1:

This example is written in C#

```voice_input
using system Œ∫—Å colon newline Œ∫—Å 
Œ∫—Å tab Œ∫—Å print Œ∫—Å left parentheses quotation marks Œ∫—Å hello world Œ∫—Å quotation marks right parentheses semicolon escape Œ∫—Å
```

#### Translates to 1:

This example is written in C#

```csharp
using system:
	print ("hello world");
```

### Glossary of escape codes

Œ∫—Å newline - Goes to the next line

Œ∫—Å newline 5 - Goes 5 lines ahead

Œ∫—Å escape - Stops the edit mode of the programming session

Œ∫—Å colon - outputs :

Œ∫—Å semicolon - outputs ;

Œ∫—Å left parentheses - outputs (

Œ∫—Å right parentheses - outputs )

Œ∫—Å quotation marks - outputs "

Œ∫—Å quotation mark - outputs '

Œ∫—Å backslash - outputs \

Œ∫—Å forward slash - outputs /

Œ∫—Å hash - outputs #

Œ∫—Å at sign - outputs @

Œ∫—Å dollar sign - outputs $

Œ∫—Å pling/exclamation mark/exclamation point - outputs !

Œ∫—Å tilde - outputs ~

Œ∫—Å percent - outputs %

Œ∫—Å carrot/carot - outputs ^

Œ∫—Å ampersand/and sign - outputs &

Œ∫—Å asterisk - outputs *

Œ∫—Å hyphen - outputs -

Œ∫—Å equals sign - outputs =

Œ∫—Å plus sign - outputs +

Œ∫—Å underscore - outputs _

Œ∫—Å left square bracket - outputs [

Œ∫—Å right square bracket - outputs ]

Œ∫—Å left curly brace/left curly bracket - outputs {

Œ∫—Å right curly brace/right curly bracket - outputs }

Other codes currently not listed

Multiple escade codes can be put into a single sequence, the only limit is how much RAM and disk space you have available. This shouldn't be a problem, unless you plan to talk for ~100,000 years straight (the 100k year example goes by the belief that the user has 4 gigabytes of RAM and 512 gigabytes of disk space, as only the voice input in text is stored in primary and secondary memory)

### Pronunciation

I don't know the word for it, it is like a gutteral k sound, a very deep K sound.

### Other notes

`Œ∫—Å` does not stand for any word in any language, I checked across 100 languages on Bing translate. it is detected as Greek, although it is Cyrillic, which is heavily modified Greek.

I have future plans for there to be a preference of what sound is needed to activate click escape mode. The main rule is that it needs to be as different from any spoken language, and cannot translate into anything.

The idea for the `Œ∫—Å` code came to me at random today. I haven' contributed to this project in a long time, because there was a feasibility problem. This was a breakthrough solution that allows TalkScript development to continue, and for TalkScript to be used as a functional programming tool for the para/quadrapalegic/blind/lazy
